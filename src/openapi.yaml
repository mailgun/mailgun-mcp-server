      The Mailgun Metrics API provides programmatic access to detailed analytics
      data about your email sending activity. This API allows you to query,
      filter, and analyze email performance metrics to gain insights into
      deliverability, engagement, and overall sending health.


      ## Metrics vs. Stats API


      The Metrics API is the modern replacement for the deprecated Stats API:


      | Feature | Stats API (Deprecated) | Metrics API (Current) |

      |---------|----------------------|---------------------|

      | Flexibility | Limited filtering | Advanced filtering with logical
      operators |

      | Dimensions | Fixed groupings | Flexible dimension combinations |

      | Metrics | Basic counts | Comprehensive metrics including rates |

      | Performance | Slower | Optimized for large datasets |

      | Future Support | None | Active development |


      **Migration:** If you're using the Stats API, plan to migrate to the
      Metrics API for continued support and new features.


      ## What Are Metrics?


      Metrics are quantitative measurements of your email activity. The Mailgun
      platform collects event data in real-time and aggregates it into
      meaningful metrics that help you understand how your emails are
      performing.


      ## Types of Metrics


      Mailgun provides two categories of metrics:


      ### Sending Metrics (via `/v1/analytics/metrics`)


      These metrics track the lifecycle and performance of your outbound emails:


      - **Volume Metrics**: Messages accepted, delivered, failed, queued

      - **Engagement Metrics**: Opens, clicks, unsubscribes

      - **Deliverability Metrics**: Bounces (permanent and temporary),
      complaints (spam reports)

      - **Rate Metrics**: Delivered rate, open rate, click rate, bounce rate

      - **ESP-Specific Metrics**: Performance broken down by email service
      provider


      See [metric
      definitions](https://documentation.mailgun.com/docs/mailgun/user-manual/reporting/metric-definitions)
      for a complete list of available metrics.


      ### Usage Metrics (via `/v1/analytics/usage/metrics`)


      These metrics track your consumption of Mailgun services and features:


      - **Email Validation**: Single validations, bulk validations, API calls

      - **Email Preview**: Preview generation counts and failures

      - **Blocklist Monitoring**: Domain and IP blocklist checks

      - **Accessibility Checks**: Accessibility validation counts

      - **Seed Testing**: Seed test campaigns sent


      ## Core Concepts


      ### Dimensions


      Dimensions are the attributes by which you can slice and group your
      metrics data. Think of them as the "categories" or "labels" for your data.


      **Available Dimensions:**


      See
      [dimensions](https://documentation.mailgun.com/docs/mailgun/user-manual/reporting/dimensions)
      for a complete list of available dimensions.


      **Example:** If you query with dimensions `["time", "domain"]`, your
      results will be grouped by time period for each sending domain.


      ### Resolution


      Resolution determines the time granularity of your results:


      - **hour**: Data grouped by hour (useful for real-time monitoring)

      - **day**: Data grouped by day (most common for daily reports)

      - **month**: Data grouped by month (useful for trend analysis)


      The resolution you choose affects how the `time` dimension groups your
      data.


      ### Time Range Selection


      You have flexible options for specifying the time range:


      **Option 1: Start and End Dates**

      ```json

      {

      "start": "Mon, 13 Nov 2023 00:00:00 -0600",

      "end": "Mon, 20 Nov 2023 23:59:59 -0600"

      }

      ```


      **Option 2: Duration**

      ```json

      {

      "duration": "7d"

      }

      ```


      This calculates the start date and end date automatically (7 days before
      the today).


      **Date Format:** RFC 2822 format with timezone support


      ### Filters


      Filters allow you to narrow down your data to specific criteria. The
      filter system uses a logical structure:


      ```json

      {

      "filter": {
        "AND": [
          {
            "attribute": "domain",
            "comparator": "=",
            "values": [
              {"value": "example.com"}
            ]
          },
          {
            "attribute": "tag",
            "comparator": "=",
            "values": [
              {"value": "newsletter"}
            ]
          }
        ]
      }

      }

      ```


      **Note:** Filters only support the "AND" operator. "OR" is not supported. 
      In the example above, only data where the sending domain equals
      `example.com` and the tag equals `newsletter` will be returned.


      **Filter Components:**

      - **attribute**: The field to filter on (domain, tag, subaccount)

      - **comparator**: The comparison operator (=, !=, contains, not contains)

      - **values**: Array of values to match against


      ### Aggregates


      When `include_aggregates` is set to `true`, the API returns top-level
      summary statistics across all your queried data. This gives you totals and
      averages without having to sum the individual items yourself.


      ### Subaccounts


      If you use Mailgun's subaccount feature, you can:

      - Query metrics for a specific subaccount using filters

      - Include all subaccounts' data with `include_subaccounts: true`

      - View aggregated data across all subaccounts


      ## Data Retention


      Mailgun retains metrics data for different durations based on resolution:

      - **Hourly**: 60 days

      - **Daily**: 1 year

      - **Monthly**: Indefinitely 


      ## Pagination


      For queries that return large result sets, the API uses offset-based
      pagination with `skip` and `limit` request attributes.


      - `skip` specifies how many items to offset (skip) from the beginning of
      the result set.

      - `limit` specifies the maximum number of items to return in a single
      request.


      Defaults and limits:

      - Default page size varies by dimension. Default for time dimension is
      1500 items. All other dimensions default to 10 items.

      - Maximum `limit` is 1500 for the time dimension and 1000 for all other
      dimensions.


      How pagination works:

      - Start with `skip=0` and a desired `limit` (for example, `limit=1000`).

      - Retrieve the next page by increasing `skip` by the value of `limit`:

      - First page: `skip=0`, `limit=1000`

      - Second page: `skip=1000`, `limit=1000`

      - Third page: `skip=2000`, `limit=1000`

      - Continue paging until fewer items than the specified `limit` are
      returned.


      Additional details:

      - The response includes a `pagination` object containing the total number
      of available items.

      - Results can be sorted using the `sort` parameter, for example `time:asc`
      or `time:desc`. 

      For consistent pagination, use a deterministic sort order.

        Remove an IP from the domain pool, unlink a DIPP or remove the domain
        pool
      description: >-
        The behavior of the endpoint depends on the value of the `ip` parameter.
        It can be

        one of the following:
         * a valid IP address: this IP address will be removed from the domain pool.
         * string `all`: the entire domain pool will be removed. As far as the system is
           concerned, such domain will no longer exist.
         * string `ip_pool`: the DIPP which is currently linked to the domain will be
           unlinked.

        ### Removing An IP

        Note that it's impossible to alter domain IPs if a DIPP is linked to the
        domain.


        If the account is not eligible for shared IPs, additional rules apply:

        It can be

        one of the following:
         * a valid IP address: this IP address will be removed from the domain pool.
         * string `all`: the entire domain pool will be removed. As far as the system is

        Note that it's impossible to alter domain IPs if a DIPP is linked to the
        domain.

        The `DIPPs` feature must be enabled for the account.


        It is not allowed to delete a DIPP inherited from the parent account.


        If the DIPP is delegated to subaccounts, those will also be updated.


        If the replacement DIPP is specified, all domains linked to the deleted
        DIPP will be

        relinked to the replacement DIPP. The latter must contain at least one
        IP.


        If the replacement IP is specified, all domains linked to the deleted
        DIPP will be

        unlinked, and the replacement IP will be assigned to them. It is not
        allowed to

        delete a DIPP inherited from the parent account and replace it with an
        IP

        (subaccounts do not explicitly manage their IPs).


        The replacement IP must be a dedicated one; it can't belong to another
        DIPP. If a

        special value `shared` is used, appropriate shared IPs will be used (the
        account must

        be eligible for shared IPs in this case).


        Omitting both replacement DIPP and replacement IP is allowed only if the
        DIPP being

        deleted contains no IPs.


        The processing of affected domains and subaccounts happens
        asynchronously after the

        endpoint returns a response.

        It's not allowed to edit a DIPP inherited from the parent account.


        IPs being added to the DIPP must be dedicated ones and belong to the

        the domains

        will be updated asynchronously (after this endpoint returns response).

            messages, the delivery window starts from the scheduled time. The

          type: string
          description: >-
            Specifies the scheduled delivery time in [RFC-2822
            format](https://documentation.mailgun.com/docs/mailgun/api-reference/api-overview#date-format).
            Depending on your plan, you can schedule messages up to 3 or 7 days
            in advance. If your domain has a custom message_ttl (time-to-live)
            setting, this value determines the maximum scheduling duration.
            Example: 'Fri, 14 Oct 2011 12:00:00 +0000'
        o:deliver-within:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Specifies the maximum time window for delivering the message.
            Accepts values in format `[0-9]+h[0-9]+m` (e.g., `1h30m`, `30m`,
            `24h`), with a minimum of `5m` and maximum of `24h`. For scheduled
            messages, the delivery window starts from the scheduled time. The
            standard retry schedule applies within this window, so shorter
            timeframes may result in fewer delivery attempts.
        o:deliverytime-optimize-period:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Toggles Send Time Optimization (STO) on a per-message basis.  String
            should be set to the number of hours in `[0-9]+h` format, with the
            minimum being `24h` and the maximum being `72h`.  This value defines
            the time window in which Mailgun will run the optimization algorithm
            based on prior engagement data of a given recipient.  See [Sending a
            Message with

            should be set to preferred delivery time in `HH:mm` or `hh:mmaa`
            format, where `HH:mm` is used for 24 hour format without AM/PM and
            hh:mmaa is used for 12 hour format with AM/PM. See [Sending a

             Note: Updating the web prefix for a domain will require also updating the domain's DNS to include the CNAME record to match. For example, if you set the web prefix to `zed` for the domain `my-domain.com`, the corresponding CNAME `zed.my-domain.com` will need to be created in your domain's dns zone.

      x-enumDescriptions:
        accepted_incoming_count: >-
          Mailgun accepted the API request to forward, and the message has been
          put in your queue. These accepted events only cover routes, forwards,
          and mailing lists. Mailing lists will record a single accepted
          incoming event, with emails sent to recipients recording their own
          accepted outgoing events.
        accepted_outgoing_count: >-
          Mailgun accepted the API request to send, and the message was put in
          your queue. Batch sends will result in one additional accepted
          outgoing event to record the initial batch request. Accepted events
          are not associated to IP addresses. The “processed” metric can be used
          in place of accepted to view data by IP.
        accepted_count: >-
          A sum of incoming and outgoing accepted events. This includes all
          accepted emails to be sent as well as routes, forwards, mailing lists,
          and batch events. To only view accepted events on emails sent to
          recipients, use the Accepted Outgoing metric. Accepted events are not
          associated to IP addresses. The “processed” metric can be used in
          place of accepted to view similar data by IP.
        delivered_smtp_count: The count of delivered events for emails sent to recipient addresses.
        delivered_http_count: The count of delivered events for routes and forwards.
        delivered_optimized_count: Emails delivered with Send Time Optimization.
        delivered_count: >-
          Mailgun sent the email and it was accepted by the recipient email
          server.
        processed_count: >-
          Messages processed after being accepted. Processed messages are billed
          to your account at the end of the month.
        sent_count: >-
          A count of all sent messages. This includes delivered and failed
          messages, but does not include suppressed messages.
        opened_count: >-
          The email recipient opened the email and enabled image viewing.
          Tracking must be turned on.
        clicked_count: >-
          The email recipient clicked on a link in the email. Click tracking
          must be turned on and the CNAME record must be pointing to
          mailgun.org.
        unique_opened_count: >-
          A unique count of open events. Opens are deduplicated on a rolling
          seven days. If you’re viewing two weeks of data, it’s possible to see
          two unique open events for a single delivered event. Keep in mind date
          ranges when viewing unique opens, if your date filter doesn’t include
          the delivery event, you may see more unique opens than delivered
          events.
        unique_clicked_count: >-
          A unique count of click events. Clicks are deduplicated on a rolling
          seven days. If you’re viewing two weeks of data, it’s possible to see
          two unique click events for a single delivered event. Keep in mind
          date ranges when viewing unique clicks, if your date filter doesn’t
          include the delivery event, you may see more unique clicks than
          delivered events.
        unsubscribed_count: >-
          The email recipient clicked on the unsubscribe link. Unsubscribe
          tracking must be turned on.
        complained_count: >-
          The email recipient clicked on the spam complaint button and the
          recipient's email server provides feedback loops to Mailgun for these
          complaints.
        failed_count: A sum of all permanent and temporary failures.
        temporary_failed_count: >-
          Mailgun could not deliver the email to the recipient email server, but
          will retry.
        permanent_failed_count: >-
          Mailgun could not deliver the email to the recipient email server, and
          will drop the message without retrying sending.
        temporary_failed_esp_block_count: >-
          Emails that were temporarily blocked by the ESP for policy errors and
          reputation rate limiting.
        permanent_failed_esp_block_count: >-
          Emails that were permanently blocked by the ESP for policy errors and
          reputation rate limiting.
        webhook_count: A count of failed webhook events.
        rate_limit_count: A count of emails that were rate limited by Mailgun.
        permanent_failed_optimized_count: >-
          Events that were sent with send time optimization, but received a
          permanent failure.
        permanent_failed_old_count: >-
          Mailgun attempted to deliver the email for the maximum number of retry
          attempts, but received a temporary failure each time. Upon the last
          retry attempt, the message was classified as a ”Too Old” permanent
          failure.
        bounced_count: >-
          A sum of all soft and hard bounces. Permanent failures fall into three
          categories, soft bounces, hard bounces, and suppressions. This field
          is equal to permanent failures minus suppressions.
        hard_bounces_count: >-
          A hard bounce is a message that cannot be delivered to its intended
          recipient due to an invalid recipient address or non-existent mailbox.
          These addresses will be automatically added to your suppressions list
          when you receive a hard bounce to prevent subsequent hard bounces.
        soft_bounces_count: >-
          A soft bounce is a message that cannot be delivered to its intended
          recipient due to a temporary delivery issue, often stemming from a
          server outage, full mailbox, oversize files/messages, blocklistings,
          or reputation issues. Mailgun treats soft bounces as permanent
          failures, meaning we will not automatically attempt to redeliver the
          message. The recipient address will not be added to the suppression
          list, and the next time you attempt to send a message to this
          recipient we will attempt to deliver.
        delayed_bounce_count: >-
          Emails were initially marked as delivered, but later received a
          permanent failure from the mailbox provider.
        suppressed_bounces_count: >-
          The email was suppressed due to a previous bounce with the recipient
          address. No delivery attempt was made.
        suppressed_unsubscribed_count: >-
          The email was suppressed due to a previous unsubscribe from the

          Emails that were delivered on the first delivery attempt without being
          delayed or bounced.
        delayed_first_attempt_count: >-
          Emails that were temporarily rejected on the first delivery attempt.
          These emails will have been retried until delivery or until a “too
          old” permanent failure is generated.
        delivered_two_plus_attempts_count: >-
          Emails that were delivered after two or more delivery attempts. This
          indicates the emails received at least one temporary failure.
        delivered_rate: >-
          The rate at which sent emails are delivered to recipient addresses.
          This calculation does not include suppressed emails.
        opened_rate: >-
          The rate at which delivered emails are opened. This calculation uses
          total opens, not unique opens. Use the unique open rate if percentages
          exceed 100%.
        clicked_rate: >-
          The rate at which delivered emails are clicked. This calculation uses
          total clicks, not unique clicks. Use the unique click rate if

        unique_opened_rate: >-
          The percentage of delivered emails that resulted in a unique click
          event. This calculation will exceed 100% if your date filter excludes
          a large amount of delivery events.
        unsubscribed_rate: >-
          The unsubscribe rate accounts for the total number of unsubscribes
          divided by the total number of emails delivered and multiplied by 100,
          expressed as a percentage.
        complained_rate: >-
          Complaint rate measures the percentages of delivered emails reported
          as spam by recipients. This rate should be kept below 0.1%. Please
          note that Gmail does not provide complaints, to see Gmail complaint
          data, sign up for Google Postmaster Tools.
        bounce_rate: >-
          Bounce rate measures the percentage of emails that bounce back, or the

        temporary_fail_rate: The percentage of sent emails that resulted in a temporary failure.
        delayed_rate: >-
          The percentage of emails that were delivered with two or more delivery
          attempts. This rate does not include delayed emails that could not be
          delivered.
        delayed_first_attempt_rate: >-
          The percentage of emails that were delivered with two or more delivery
          attempts or failed to deliver after repeated attempts. The denominator
          is the processed_count
